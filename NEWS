Version 20061010

  Fixed 'smvtoaig' for latches with 'init' but no 'next'.

Version 20061005
 
  Beta version and second public release.

  Renamed 'big' to 'aig' and 'aig' to 'aag' to reflect the fact that
  the old binary 'big' is really the default format.  There is no
  '.big' file extension any more.

  Dropped second field in symbol table entries, since it was redundant.

Version 20060915

  Alpha version and first public release.
