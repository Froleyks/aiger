Version 20061005
 
 Beta version and second public release.

 Renamed 'big' to 'aig' and 'aig' to 'aag' to reflect the fact that
 the old binary 'big' format is really the default format.  There is no
 '.big' file extension any more.

 Dropped second field in symbol table entries, since it was redundant.

Version 20060915

  Alpha version and first public release.
