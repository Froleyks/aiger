	 The AIGER And-Inverter Graph (AIG) Format Version 20060908
	 ----------------------------------------------------------
	    Armin Biere, Johannes Kepler University, 2006

  This report describes the AIG file format as used by the AIGER library.
  The purpose of this report is not only to document the format, but also
  to precisely define the format to allow independent implementations of
  writers and readers.

Introduction

  The name AIGER contains as one part the acronym AIG of And-Inverter
  Graphs [1] and also if pronounced in German sounds like the name of the
  'Eiger', a mountain in the Swiss alps.  This choice should emphasize the
  origin of this format. It was first openly discussed at the Alpine
  Verification Meeting 2006 in Ascona as a way to provide a simple, compact
  file format for a model checking competition affiliated to CAV 2007.

Acknowledgements

  The format went through various incarnations even before real code became
  available.  In particular the following colleagues gave invaluable
  feedback on earlier drafts.

      Alessandro Cimatti, Koen Claessen, Niklas Een, Marc Herbstritt,
      Ken McMillan, Fabio Somenzi, Niklas Soerenson.

  We would also want to thank Holger Hermmans who started the discussion on
  having a model checking competition affiliated to CAV and also provided
  strong support after the idea became more concrete.

Design Choices
  
  The format should allow to model sequential circuits.

  The format should allow to model combinational circuits.
  
  Model checking problems can be described.

  Structural SAT problems can be described.

  The operators are restricted to bit level.

  The set of operators needs to be as simple as possible.

  A binary format should be available.

  Symbol tables and comments can be included.

  The format should be as easy as possible to write by programs.

  The format should be as easy as possible to read by programs.
